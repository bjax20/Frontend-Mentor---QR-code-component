## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned on using the article instead of making the main section as the card itself. Also, in my previous work, to round the edges of the square, i need to do it on the image and its wrapper. But i realized its repetitive and i can just use overflow: hidden to hid the overlaps. I am starting to get comfortable with using flexbox. Before, i cannot even imagine where to start or how to approach it. Thanks the flexbox froggy. 


### Continued development

I want to be comfortable with using overflow, determining the width, and maximizing semantic elements and accessbility.
